    <details><summary>What is MGRNZ?</summary><p>MGRNZ is where automation meets attitude. We build creative systems — AI, workflows, and tools — that scale your business without flattening your personality.</p></details>

    <details><summary>Who runs MGRNZ?</summary><p>MGRNZ is the personal lab of Mike G. Robinson — entrepreneur, AI tinkerer, and accidental designer. The brand grew out of automation experiments that got too good not to share.</p></details>

    <details><summary>What kind of projects do you take on?</summary><p>We help creators and small teams automate, scale, and brand smartly — from content ops and Notion syncs to AI assistants and workflow mapping.</p></details>

    <details><summary>Do you build websites?</summary><p>Yes — but we build them intelligently. WordPress, Hugo, or headless setups — always paired with automation, analytics, and brand DNA baked in.</p></details>

    <details><summary>Can you integrate with my existing tools?</summary><p>Almost always. We work with Notion, Supabase, Make, Zapier, Google Workspace, Shopify, and anything else with an API (and some that shouldn’t have one).</p></details>

    <details><summary>Is everything AI-generated?</summary><p>Nope. We use AI to assist, not replace. Every piece — from content to workflow — still gets human direction and brand tuning.</p></details>

    <details><summary>What’s the difference between automation and AI?</summary><p>Automation moves tasks; AI makes decisions. We blend both — so your system doesn’t just work, it thinks.</p></details>

    <details><summary>What’s a “custom AI assistant”?</summary><p>A branded, trained chatbot or workflow bot that knows your business. It can draft, research, answer queries, or push data between systems.</p></details>

    <details><summary>Do you offer content services?</summary><p>Yes — human-led, AI-assisted content that matches your brand voice. Blog posts, SEO pages, and campaign landing flows are our usual suspects.</p></details>

    <details><summary>Can you match my brand style?</summary><p>Absolutely. We use your existing assets (logos, fonts, tone guides) or create a mini style system that AI tools can follow consistently.</p></details>

    <details><summary>What’s “Funk My Brand”?</summary><p>Our creative playground — bold visuals, playful copy, and branding that breaks the boring.</p></details>

    <details><summary>How do I book a call?</summary><p>Right here — hit <strong>Schedule a Chat</strong> (Calendly popup) or use the contact form.</p></details>

    <details><summary>Do you work internationally?</summary><p>Yes. Most of our systems run in the cloud — timezone is a detail, not a dealbreaker.</p></details>

    <details><summary>Where’s my data stored?</summary><p>We use privacy-first tools — Supabase, Notion, and your preferred platforms. You retain ownership of all data and credentials.</p></details>
